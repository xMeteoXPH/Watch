# Final Steps - You're Almost Done! 🚀

## ✅ What I Just Did:
- Updated `script.js` to use your Railway URL: `https://watch-production-e219.up.railway.app`

## 📤 Next Steps:

### Step 1: Upload Updated script.js to GitHub
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Upload the updated `script.js` file (or commit and push if using Git)
3. Railway will automatically detect the change and redeploy (or you can manually trigger a deployment)

### Step 2: Test It!
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. The webpage should now connect to your Railway server (not localhost)
3. Create a room and test the features!

## 🎉 What Works Now:

✅ **Online Server:** Your server is running on Railway  
✅ **Anyone Can Access:** Share your webpage URL and Railway server URL  
✅ **File Sharing:** One person uploads, everyone can watch  
✅ **Real-time Sync:** Playback syncs automatically  
✅ **Chat:** Real-time messaging works  

## 📝 Important Notes:

1. **Keep Railway Running:** Your server stays online 24/7 (on free tier, it might sleep after inactivity but wakes up when someone uses it)

2. **Two URLs:**
   - **Webpage:** Your `index.html` file (can host on GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)
   - **Server:** `https://watch-production-e219.up.railway.app` (already online!)

3. **For Others to Use:**
   - They need the webpage files (`index.html`, `script.js`, `styles.css`)
   - The `script.js` already points to your Railway server
   - They can just open the webpage - no terminal needed!

## 🎬 You're All Set!

Your MovieHub is now live and accessible online! Others can use it without running any servers locally.
